This challenge is to build your own JSON parser.

Building a JSON parser is an easy way to learn about parsing techniques which are useful for everything from parsing simple data formats through to building a fully featured compiler for a programming language.

Parsing is often broken up into two stages: lexical analysis and syntactic analysis. 
Lexical analysis is the process of dividing a sequence of characters into meaningful chunks, called tokens. 
Syntactic analysis (which is also sometimes referred to as parsing) is the process of analysing the list of tokens to match it to a formal grammar.

JSON - JavaScript Object Notation - a lightweight data-interchange format, which is widely used for transmitting data over the internet.
