# Build your Own - Word Count

## Description

This challenge is to build your own version of the Unix command line tool wc!
Build your own version of Unix command line tool 'wc'.
wc - word, line, character, and byte count. 

## Step 1
Simple version of wc. Let's call it ccwc that takes the command line option -c and outputs number of bytes in a file.

## Step 2
In this step, the goal is to support the command line option -l that outputs the number of lines in a file.

## Step 3
In this step, the goal is to support the command line option -w that outputs the number of words in a file.

## Step 4
In this step, the goal is to support the command line option -m that outputs the number of characters in a file.

## Step 5
In the step, the goal is to support the default option - i.e. no options are provided, which is equivalent to the -c, -l, and -w options. 

-c -> counts characters in the file.
-l -> counts number of lines in the file. 
-w -> count number of words in the file.

## Step 6
The goal is to support being able to read from standard input if no filename is specified.
