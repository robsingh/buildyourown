# About the Project
Coding Challenges - Build Your Own

In every challenge I will be writing a full application or tool. Most of them are real world tools and utilities. 

# Language or Frameworks Used

I will be using Python to complete these challenges. Later on, the goal is to accomplish the challenges in other languages. 

# Structure of the Challenge

Each script will have the doc string to explain about the challenge. Every step is outlined in the docstrings and the following code will be the solution to the particular step. I will follow a more organized approach once I have completed more challenges. 
I am going to change the file structure of these challenges once I am done with couple of challenges. I do have a plan in my mind. 

# Contributions

If you would like to contribute to this repository in any way, be it code, a better organizing approach or anything that crosses your mind, please feel free to raise a pull request. It would really encourage me if I could see this repository starred (no I will not star it myself :p)


# Acknowledgments

I always thrive to be a better version of myself in every aspect of my life. I'd love to keep learning and growing. 

The idea of 'build your own' is inspired by - https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/intro

Thank you. Let's code!
