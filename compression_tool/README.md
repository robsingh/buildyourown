# Build your Own - Compression Tool - Huffman Encoder/Decoder

## Background
David Huffman developed an algorithm to find the optimal prefix code that can be used for loseless data compression.
For example, we have the string aabbcc - it would normally takes 6 bytes, but if we assign *each character* a variable length code, with most frequently occuring character has the shortest code, we might assign them the code as:
a: 1
b: 01
c: 10
and we could reduce the string aabbcc (6 bytes) to 1101011010 (10 bits). These prefix-free codes are generated by creating a binary tree.

## Description
The challenge is to build your own command line tool to compress text files. 

## Step 1
In this step your goal is to build your tool to accept a filename as input. It should return an error if the file is not valid, otherwise your program should open it, read the text and determine the frequency of each character occurring within the text.
