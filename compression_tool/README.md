# Build your Own - Compression Tool

## Description
The challenge is to build your own command line tool to compress text files. 

## Step 1
In this step your goal is to build your tool to accept a filename as input. It should return an error if the file is not valid, otherwise your program should open it, read the text and determine the frequency of each character occurring within the text.
